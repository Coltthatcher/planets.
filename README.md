## Description

_This project was an independent project for my full time Epicodus curriculum, it was an example of classes, constructors, and TDD with jest. While the code has no working UI functionality, the business logic is in place. The code in practice should take a users age and planet they are on and return their current "space" age, how many years they have left to live on the planet, or if they surpassed their life expectancy on the planet._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _go to GITHUB and clone the remote url to your local repository_
* _run npm run install to get jest working_
* _run separate tests in jest with npm run test_
* _once you reach 100% coverage in jest with tests move on to the next planets_





## Known Bugs

* _No Bugs_
